# trello
Basic Trello API Wrapper built on Python 3.6

Currently the wrapper only supports GET requests, and 3 built in functions, getBoards(), getLists(), and getCards()

The wrapper will be updated as I need to update it for projects in the future.

POST requests will be added in the future if needed

NOTE: You need to retrieve your own API key, and TOKEN here: https://trello.com/app-key
